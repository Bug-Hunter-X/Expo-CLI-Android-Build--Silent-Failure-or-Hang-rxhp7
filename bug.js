This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message might be vague, offering little guidance. The build process appears to hang indefinitely or fail silently, without providing specific details about the cause.  This can be frustrating because there is no clear error message to help troubleshoot the problem. Sometimes the build process may show progress for some time before ultimately failing.  The exact cause can vary but often relates to underlying issues with the Android build system, dependencies, or project configuration.
