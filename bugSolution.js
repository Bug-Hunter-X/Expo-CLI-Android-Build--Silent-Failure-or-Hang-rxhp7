// Check for and resolve dependency conflicts:
//  - Use npm ls or yarn why to analyze dependencies. 
//  - Update outdated packages.
//  - Verify compatibility between packages.

// Clean the build cache:
//  - expo prebuild --clean 

// Verify Android environment setup:
//   - Ensure that the Android SDK is properly installed and configured. 
//   - Check your JAVA environment variables (JAVA_HOME).
//   - Consider deleting the `.gradle` and `node_modules` folders and reinstalling packages.   

// Review your project's configuration files:
//   - Check your app.json or app.config.js for any potential configuration errors. 
//   - Inspect the gradle files for issues.

// Examine detailed logs:
//   - The Android build system may produce more details in logs (which can often be viewed in the terminal during the build).
//   - Look for warnings or errors.  
//   - Search online using specifics from logs.

// Check for device/emulator compatibility issues:
//   - Ensure your testing device/emulator meets the minimum requirements. 
//   - Test on another device or emulator.

// Consider a clean project rebuild:
//   - Delete the `.expo` and `android` directories from your project. 
//   - Remove your node_modules folder, and re-install.
//   - Try running the build again.

// If the problem persists, providing detailed logs with the Expo CLI output would be essential for further diagnosis.
