# Expo CLI Android Build: Silent Failure or Hang

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue encountered when building Android APKs with the Expo CLI. The build process may hang indefinitely or terminate without providing clear error messages, making debugging challenging.

## Problem Description

The core problem lies in the lack of informative error messages from the Expo CLI during the Android build process.  The build may appear to be progressing, but then ultimately fails without specific details. This issue stems from underlying problems in the Android build environment or within project dependencies.  There is no standard, easily identifiable error message.

## Solution

The solution involves several debugging steps and potential fixes.  See the `bugSolution.js` file and accompanying comments for detailed instructions and code examples to address this issue.  Common solutions involve checking dependencies, cleaning the build cache, verifying Android environment settings, and more.
